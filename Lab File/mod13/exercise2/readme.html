In this exercise, you will convert the Calculator GUI to be dual-purpose:
existing both as a stand-alone application and as an applet.

<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by coping the <TT>CalculatorGUI</TT> class file into your working directory
from the <TT>events</TT> exercise directory.
</P>

<P>
Split the original code into three class files: <TT>CalculatorGUI</TT>,
<TT>CalcApp</TT>, and <TT>CalcApplet</TT>.  Compile and run the application using the
<TT>java</TT> interpreter and the applet using <TT>appletviewer</TT>.
