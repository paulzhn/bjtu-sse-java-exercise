<H3>Exercise #2: Use Threads in Applet Animation</H3>
<H3>(Level 2)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will use a thread to control the animation within an applet.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>

<OL>

  <LI>Create an applet called <TT>ThreadedAnimation</TT> that takes 10
      images of Duke waving (in the graphics/Duke directory) and displays
      them in a sequence that makes it look like Duke is waving.
      <P>

  <LI>Use the <TT>MediaTracker</TT> class to smooth the loading of these images.
      The following code will help:
<PRE>
// Instance variable
Image[] images = new Image[10];

// Somewhere in the init() method
MediaTracker mt = new MediaTracker(this);
for(int x = 0; x < images.length; x++) {
  String imageFile = "graphics/Duke/T"+(x+1)+".gif";
  images[x] = getImage(getDocumentBase(),imageFile);
  mt.addImage(images[x],0); // Add image to group 0
}
mt.waitForID(0); // blocks until all images in group 0 are fully loaded
</PRE>
      <P>

  <LI>Allow the user to stop and start the animation using successive mouse clicks.
      <P>
